# infra.ee_utilities.virtualenv_migrate

Use this role to create a list of python requirements from custom virtualenvs present in your AAP 1.2 cluster, after comparing those with requirements in Default Execution Environment.
This role is based on the `awx-manage` utility and needs an AAP1.2 tower node to gather requirements from and localhost to pull EE and compare those requirements.
This role sets the python requirements to `ee_python` variable, which can then be used by the ee_utilities role to create a new EE.

This role must be run against the tower AAP(1.2) host. As the same objects exist on multiple tower nodes in same cluster, ideally you can run this against one of those nodes and it will give sufficient results.

This role is supposed to work with the tower AAP(1.2) nodes only, which had the ability to create custom virtualenvs instead of execution environments.

This role should be run as root or become:true

Sample inventory file looks like this

```ini
[tower]
TOWER_HOST ansible_ssh_private_key=<>
```

## Requirements

podman on localhost
