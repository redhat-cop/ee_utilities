        of its essential features: * It is implemented entirely in Python. * It uses
        LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars.
        * PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for
        empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for ambiguous
        grammars. * PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error
        checking. * PLY doesn''t try to do anything more or less than provide the basic
        lex/yacc functionality. In other words, it''s not a large parsing framework
        or a component of some larger system.  Python 3 version.'

      description: PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular
        expression) library to provide an entirely new API.  PCRE2 is written in C,
        and it has its own API. There are three sets of functions, one for the 8-bit
        library, which processes strings of bytes, one for the 16-bit library, which
        processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for the 32-bit library, which processes
        strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++ wrappers. This package provides support
        for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8 encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or pcre2-utf32
        packages for the other ones.  The distribution does contain a set of C wrapper
        functions for the 8-bit library that are based on the POSIX regular expression
        API (see the pcre2posix man page). These can be found in a library called libpcre2posix.
        Note that this just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular
        expressions themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API
        is restricted, and does not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.

        enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts per minute.  On
        Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward compatible
        with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library. This means that
        all existing binary executables linked against glibc''s libcrypt should work
        unmodified with this library''s libcrypt.so.1.  We have taken pains to provide
        exactly the same "symbol versions" as were used by glibc on various CPU architectures,
        and to account for the variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were
        patched into glibc''s libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
        compatibility symlinks for SuSE''s "libowcrypt" are provided.)  However, the
        converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt will not work with glibc''s
        libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain legacy APIs supplied by glibc''s
        libcrypt (''encrypt'', ''encrypt_r'', ''setkey'', ''setkey_r'', and ''fcrypt'')
        cannot be compiled against libxcrypt.'

        the end application which consumes the library.  If you are packaging an application,

        library uses the netlink interface and exports easy to use APIs so that a developer
        does not need to consider the low-level netlink interface handling.  The library
        does not implement any cipher algorithms.  All consumer requests are sent to
        the kernel for processing.  Results from the kernel crypto API are returned
        to the consumer via the library API.  The kernel interface and therefore this
        library can be used by unprivileged processes.

      description: Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
        conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate compilation
        to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention". The calling convention
        is a set of assumptions made by the compiler about where function arguments
        will be found on entry to a function.  A calling convention also specifies where
        the return value for a function is found.  Some programs may not know at the
        time of compilation what arguments are to be passed to a function.  For instance,
        an interpreter may be told at run-time about the number and types of arguments
        used to call a given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide
        a bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.  The `libffi' library
        provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions.  This
        allows a programmer to call any function specified by a call interface description
        at run time.  FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
        interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in
        one language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi' library
        really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured
        foreign function interface.  A layer must exist above `libffi' that handles
        type conversions for values passed between the two languages.
